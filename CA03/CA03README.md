CA 03 - README
Purpose: The purpose of this program, file CA 03, is to present the decision tree algorithm on census data in order to be able to predict characteristics about them. The decision tree model project has  parts
Data Quality Analysis
Building the decision tree classifier models
Evaluating the decision tree performance
Tuning Decision Tree Performance
Vizualise the best decision tree with Graphiz
Predict with trained model
The libraries necessary to conduct this program and be able to run the code: Pandas Sklearn Os Matplotlib Numpy Counter from collections What versions of various software / libraries are you using:
Python 3 (ipykernel) numpy=1.22.1 pandas== 1.4.0 matplotlib= 3.5.1
