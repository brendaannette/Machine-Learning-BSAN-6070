CA 02 - README 

Purpose:
The purpose of this program, file CA 02, is to replicate a spam email detector. It uses the Naives Bayes classification algorithm to identify which emails are spam or not based on the words found in the email’s files. In this program there are 260 emails used to test the model out of the 702 emails that are equally divided into spam and not spam categories. The model is made to predict the categories of the emails and compare the accuracy with the data that is already known using classification evaluation metrics.


The libraries necessary to conduct this program and be able to run the code:
Pandas
Sklearn
Os
Matplotlib 
Numpy
Counter from collections
 What versions of various software / libraries are you using:

Python 3 (ipykernel)
numpy=1.22.1
pandas== 1.4.0
matplotlib= 3.5.1

The dataset used for this program and its source: 
The dataset used to run this program was provided by Professor Arin Brahma as a data zip file containing folders with the data of the test and training mail data.

The files are included to be downloaded to run the program in the CA 02 folder, “test-mails” and “train-mails.”

Code Acknowledgements:
A large percentage of this code was written by Professor Brahma and Datacamp’s Naive Bayes Classification using Scikit-learn — DataCamp Workspace was also used to help complete this program.

How to install and run your code along with datasets to run program:

Download folder from GitHub containing Jupyter notebook ("CA02_NB_assignment(1)"), the "train-mails" folder, and the "test-mails" folder.
Upload folder to coding environment: Google Colab or Jupyter lab. Make sure the folders containing the text files are in the same directory as the notebook.
Enter the path of your train-mails and test-mails folders in the TRAIN_DIR and TEST_DIR.
Run notebook to view results.
